I am an avid twitter user and want to know how the sentiment of my tweets and face correspond to different types of dogs. To do this I go to our web app, log in to my twitter account,  take a picture with my webcam and upload the results. After clicking submit, I am shown what type of dog I am along with information regarding how the dog was chosen (i.e. the top sentiments that were taken from my tweets and face).

I would like to see what types of dog I look like according to my tweets so I go to our web app. In the log-in interface, I click “log-in with Twitter account”. I put my Twitter ID and password, but I failed to log-in. I go back to the original log-in interface that now says “Invalid password” in red. I try to log-in again, but I failed 5 times. Then I see the “Forgot password?” below the log-in interface, and I am able to use my email to reset my password and finally get into the web app.

I am not a twitter user, or am a very seldom user of twitter, but I still want to know if the app can formulate what type of dog I am. I go to the web app, log in to my twitter account, take a picture of myself and upload the results. After clicking submit, the web app displays a pop-up message informing me that there wasn’t enough viable data from my tweets to formulate a tweet-based result. The pop-up asks me if I would still like to continue onto the result using just the uploaded picture; I click yes and am then shown what type of dog I am along with information regarding how the dog was chosen (key facial features etc.)

I am an active Twitter user; I decided that I wanted to use this web app to determine what type of dog my tweets and pictures reflected.  When prompted to enter my Twitter log in, I was hesitant to proceed. A history of my data being misused on other platforms has made me wary of allowing third-party apps to access my information. I looked for an option that allowed me to link the URL of the tweets I wanted to have analyzed or to only upload pictures. I chose the images-only option and was finally shown the dog that most resembled myself.
